<body>
    <p>Mumbai's missing children cases from June to December 2025 total 145, with 93 girls, peaking at 26 in June and including 82 from November 1 to December 6 across stations like Kurla, Vakola, and Powai. Many involve teens fleeing family issues or love affairs, though trafficking suspicions persist; police recovered a four-year-old from Varanasi after six months missing. Navi Mumbai separately reported 499 cases in 11 months (Jan-Nov 2025), recovering 458, with causes like elopements (128) and parental scoldings (114).​

<h3>Nationwide Statistics</h3>
<p>
Since 2020, about 300,000 children went missing across India, with nearly 36,000 still untraced as of early 2025; Bihar leads with 12,600+ unresolved from 24,000+ cases, followed by Madhya Pradesh (3,955 from 58,665) and Odisha (4,852 from 24,291). States like Delhi, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu failed to submit data despite reminders, hindering national tracking. The Khoya-Paya portal tracks missing/found children, while anti-trafficking units handle unresolved cases after four months.</p>
<h3>Police and Court Actions</h3>
<p>
Mumbai Police debunked viral "82 kids in 36 days kidnapped by gang" claims as misleading, noting 98% recovery rate over five years and deploying Crime Branch teams. Supreme Court directed nodal officers for data collection by December 31, 2025, and a central repository amid inter-state trafficking probes. Centre allocated Rs 100 crore for anti-trafficking units in every district, emphasizing prevention and prosecution.​
